# sportsfont
A font containing icons for sports.

This font was created using http://www.fontello.com .

Some icons are taken from Maki by Mapbox - you can find this on fontello.

Some icon SVG images were found on http://www.flaticon.com .

# Installation

To install the sports font, download the source and include the following files:

./css/sports.css

All font files contained in ./font will need to be stored relative to the css directory. If you would like to store the font on a different path, the paths at the top of ./css/sports.css
will need to be modified.

Use this font as you will - I don't mind!

# Adding to the font

Please use the great tool fontello, the icons I added are contained in the ./src folder.
